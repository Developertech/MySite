			<p>
                I've had an interest in technology for most of my life, particulary when it comes to troubleshooting. When entering college 
                it was natural to aim for IT degree. After getting a bachelors in 2012 I worked in a help desk position for a year. Thereafter and currently, I shifted
                into an IT call center. For an added challenge presently I study programming in my free time. Right now my language of choice is C# ASP.Net following the MVC architechure.

                Though my career has just begun there is one thing that holds true no matter where you go - teamwork helps makes the best products
                and most efficient services. There is only so far one can go without the collaboration of another to reach the next milestone in delivering top-notch goods or services.
                While able to independently achieve results I am glad I've worked in some of the best team environments so far.

		<hr />
		<p>
            I think it's fair to say that personal computers have become the most empowering tool we've ever created. They're tools of communication, they're tools of creativity, and they can be
             shaped by their user. --Bill Gates
